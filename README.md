# 🚀 DataPulse 
## Automated DataOps Platform for Real-Time Data Monitoring

---

## 📖 Project Overview

**DataPulse** is a robust and automated DataOps platform designed to enable **real-time monitoring**, **data validation**, and **alerting** of data pipelines with minimal manual effort. This end-to-end system fetches data, cleans and validates it, transforms for insights, and visualizes metrics—all while ensuring data quality through continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
