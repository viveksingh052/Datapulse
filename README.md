DataPulse — Automated DataOps Platform for Real-Time Data Monitoring

Project Overview
DataPulse is an automated DataOps platform designed to provide real-time monitoring, validation, and alerting of data pipelines. This project aims to simplify and streamline the process of ensuring data quality, enabling data engineers and analysts to detect issues early, maintain data reliability, and deliver actionable insights continuously.

Built primarily with Python and integrated with modern automation and CI/CD workflows, DataPulse covers the entire data lifecycle — from ingestion to visualization and notification — minimizing manual intervention and maximizing operational efficiency.

Features
Automated Data Collection: Periodically fetch data from public APIs or data sources, or process uploaded CSV files.

Data Cleaning & Validation: Apply data validation checks and clean datasets automatically to maintain data integrity.

Data Transformation: Process raw data to create meaningful metrics and calculated fields for better analysis.

Interactive Dashboard: Use Streamlit to visualize data trends, summaries, and key performance indicators in real-time.

Automated Alerting: Send email notifications when anomalies or failures are detected in the data pipeline.

CI/CD Integration: Automate testing, deployment, and monitoring with GitHub Actions to ensure smooth and consistent delivery.

Version Control: Maintain all code and configurations in GitHub for collaboration and traceability.

Technologies Used
Python: Core language for data processing and automation.

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical computations.

Streamlit: Dashboard creation for interactive data visualization.

Git & GitHub: Source control and collaboration.

GitHub Actions: Continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines.

SMTP Email: Sending automated alert emails.

Docker (optional): Containerize the application for easy deployment.

cd Datapulse
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate       # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the data pipeline:

bash
Copy
Edit
python run_pipeline.py
Launch the dashboard:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
Usage
The pipeline fetches, cleans, and transforms data automatically.

The Streamlit dashboard displays real-time data insights.

Alerts are sent via email if anomalies or pipeline issues are detected.

CI/CD Integration
This project uses GitHub Actions to automate:

Code quality checks and testing on every push or pull request.

Deployment of the dashboard and pipeline updates.

Notification triggers based on pipeline health.

Workflow files are located in the .github/workflows directory.
